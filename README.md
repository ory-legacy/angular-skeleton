Baldur.io is a *Content Repository*, similar to traditional *Content Management Systems (CMS)* like *Drupal*, *Wordpress*,
*Joomla* or others.

This application is an example website based on baldur, but in contrast to traditional CMS there is no need for any
server side logic like PHP, MySQL, Java, Python, Ruby, ASP or even Apache!

You're not a developer? Don't be afraid. It's really simple.

You are a developer? Don't be afraid. You may find more advanced skeletons here:

* Webapp built with nodejs, npm, bower and tests.
* A protected website.
* A Website based on user generated content.
* ...

Baldur works with all programming languages. There are some libraries which help you to progress faster:
* Java Library
* PHP Library
* Go Library
* ...

## Install

1. Create a new app on [baldur.io](https://baldur.io) - don't worry, it's free of charge.
* Baldur provides you with a *public access token*. Copy that into your clipboard!
* [Download (missing link)](/) the package and extract it anywhere you want.
* Open `config.json` and replace `enter your token here` with the *public access token* you just copied.
* You will need Apache, Ngnix or some other http service to serve your web app. For development we precompiled a http service:
 * [Windows x64 HTTP Server](/)
 * [Linux x64 HTTP Server](/)
 * [Mac OS x64 HTTP Server](/)

You may [edit (missing link)](/) or [create (missing link)](/) pages or content. The website will update these
contents automatically.
