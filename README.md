Baldur.io is a *Content Repository*, similar to traditional *Content Management Systems (CMS)* like *Drupal*, *Wordpress*,
*Joomla* or others.

This application is an example website based on baldur, but in contrast to traditional CMS there is no need for any
server side logic like PHP, MySQL, Java, Python, Ruby, ASP or even Apache!

You're not a developer? Don't be afraid. It's really simple.

* [Download (missing link)](/) the package and extract it anywhere you want.
* Open `config.json` and replace `enter your token here` with the *public access token* you just copied.
* Drag & drop `index.html` onto your browser (or use Apache/Ngnix/...)

You are now able to [edit (missing link)](/) or [create (missing link)](/) pages. The website will update these
contents automatically.
